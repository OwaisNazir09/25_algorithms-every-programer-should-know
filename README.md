Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know

---

Welcome to the "Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know" repository! This collection comprises 25 essential algorithms that every programmer should be familiar with. Below is a list of these algorithms along with brief descriptions:

1. Binary Search : Efficiently locates a target value within a sorted array.


2. QuickSort: A fast sorting algorithm that recursively divides arrays into smaller sub-arrays.


3. Merge Sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the input array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them.


4. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.


5. Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.


6. Selection Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.


7. Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.


8. Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.



9. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.


10. Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, even with negative edge weights.


11. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.


12. Binary Tree Traversal: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of binary trees.


13. A Algorithm: A pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes on a weighted graph.


14. Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming): Solves the problem of packing the knapsack with the most valuable items without exceeding the weight capacity.

15. Dynamic Programming: Solves problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and using the solutions to those subproblems to solve the larger problem.


16. Hashing: Converts a given key into an index of an array by performing certain operations on it.



17. Kruskal's Algorithm: Finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.


18. Prim's Algorithm: Finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.


19. Bresenham's Line Algorithm: Determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points.


20. KMP Algorithm: Searches for occurrences of a "word" within a main "text" string by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.


21. Rabin-Karp Algorithm: A string-searching algorithm that searches for patterns in strings using hash functions.


22. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm): Finds the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array with the largest sum.


23. Topological Sorting: Arranges the nodes in a directed graph in such a way that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering.


24. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (Max Flow): Computes the maximum flow in a flow network.


25. Monte Carlo Algorithm: Utilizes random sampling to obtain numerical results.
